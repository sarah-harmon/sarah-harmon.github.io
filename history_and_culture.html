  <h2 id="underground"> Underground Tours </h2>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Seattle_Underground_Tour_03.jpg">
  	<P>
  		The Seattle Underground is a network of underground passageways and basements in downtown Seattle, Washington, that was ground level at the city's origin in the mid-19th century. After the streets were elevated these spaces fell into disuse, but have become a tourist attraction in recent decades. A quick google search will show you all the options you have for taking tours of the seattle underground. Tours range from the regular family friendly versions to "adult tours" that focus on the seedier aspects of old seattle.

	<h2 id="art"> Seattle Art Museum </h2>
	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/SAM_Art_Ladder_02.jpg">
  	<P>
  		The Seattle Art Museum (commonly known as "SAM") is an art museum located in Seattle. It maintains three major facilities: its main museum in downtown Seattle; the Seattle Asian Art Museum (SAAM) in Volunteer Park on Capitol Hill, and the Olympic Sculpture Park on the central Seattle waterfront, which opened on January 20, 2007. Admission to the sculpture park is always free. Admission to the other facilities is free on the first Thursday of each month; SAM also offers free admission the first Saturday of the month. And even the normal admission is suggested, meaning that the museum would like visitors to pay the complete admission but if they can not pay fully they can still enjoy the museum.

  	<h2 id="sanjuan"> San Juan Island Camps </h2>
  	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/San_Juan_Island_NHP_Eng_Camp.JPG">
  		<p>
  			San Juan Island National Historical Park, also known as American and English Camps, San Juan Island, is a U.S. National Historical Park owned and operated by the National Park Service on San Juan Island in the state of Washington. The park is made up of the sites of the British and U.S. Armies' camps during the Pig War. Both of these camps were set up in 1859 as response to a border dispute triggered by the killing of a pig. The camps were occupied for 12 years, until the Treaty of Washington was signed, negotiated by Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany. The British abandoned their camp in November 1872, while the American camp was disbanded in July 1874.

  		Chinook Point is a headland in Pacific County, Washington. Captain Robert Gray, the first non-native to enter the Columbia River, saw the river from Chinook Point in 1792. His explorations gave the United States a strong position in its later territorial contests with Great Britain.
